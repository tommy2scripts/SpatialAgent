Given a user task, decide if it needs workflow templates, and if so, select up to {num_skills} most relevant ones.

Available templates: {skill_names}

**Template descriptions:**

- panel_design: Design gene panels through iterative database queries (CZI CELLxGENE → PanglaoDB → CellMarker2). Use when: "design a gene panel", "find markers for cell types", "build a panel for spatial experiment", marker gene selection for targeted spatial assays.

- annotation: Cell type and tissue niche annotation in spatial transcriptomics data. Use when: "annotate cell types", "identify tissue regions", "label clusters", "what cell types are in this spatial data", cluster annotation, niche identification.

- cell_cell_communication: Cell-cell interaction analysis comparing ligand-receptor pairs across conditions. Use when: "compare interactions between conditions", "how do cell communications change", "cross-condition CCC analysis", differential interaction analysis.

- database_query: Query biological databases including: (1) MSigDB gene sets (C2 curated, C5 ontology/mouse phenotypes, C6 oncogenic signatures, C7 immunologic/vaccine response signatures) and GTRD for transcription factor binding sites in promoter regions, (2) miRDB v6.0 for miRNA target predictions, (3) P-HIPSter for virus-host protein interactions, (4) ClinVar for variant pathogenicity (questions with protein sequences and variant options like L1256P, N414H), (5) Ensembl for gene locations and cytogenetic bands, (6) DisGeNET/OMIM for disease associations, (7) MouseMine/MGI for mouse phenotype (MP:) gene sets. Use when: "which gene is contained in the gene set", "gene set contains", "C6 oncogenic signature", "genes up-regulated", "genes down-regulated", gene set names ending in "_UP" or "_DN" (e.g., AKT_UP_MTOR_DN.V1_UP, BCAT_BILD_ET_AL_DN), "C5 ontology", "mouse phenotype", "binding site in promoter", "TF targets according to GTRD", "miRNA target according to miRDB", "MIR" followed by numbers (e.g., MIR2115_3P, MIR194_5P), "predicted target of MIR", "virus-host interaction", "P-HIPSter", "pathogenic or benign", "According to ClinVar", "ClinVar", "which variant", "variants to the following sequence", "most likely to be pathogenic", "most likely to be benign", "chromosomal location", "cytogenetic band", "transcription factor targets", disease-gene queries, MSigDB queries, "MouseMine", "MGI", "Mouse Genome Informatics", "MP:", "mouse gene", "retrieved from MouseMine". **IMPORTANT:** For gene set membership questions, ALWAYS query the local parquet database files first - do NOT use web search. **Note:** Multiple choice questions about miRNA targets, gene sets, diseases, or variants that require database lookup should use this skill.

- sequence_analysis: DNA/RNA/protein sequence analysis including: (1) BLAST identification of unknown sequences, (2) restriction enzyme digestion and fragment counting, (3) primer design for Gibson assembly and restriction cloning, (4) ORF finding, (5) variant detection, (6) Kozak consensus and translation efficiency analysis, (7) fetching gene/plasmid sequences from NCBI.

Use when: you have H&E images with cell segmentation and want to assign cell types to individual segmented cells, "assign cells to segments", single-cell resolution from spots.

- cellphonedb_analysis: Run CellPhoneDB for ligand-receptor interaction prediction with statistical permutation testing. Use when: "run CellPhoneDB", "predict interactions", "ligand-receptor pairs", "which cells are communicating", single-sample CCC analysis with p-values.

- ligand_receptor_discovery: Comprehensive workflow to discover and validate ligand-receptor interactions with literature cross-validation. Use when: "find new interactions", "validate LR pairs", "immune checkpoint interactions", "growth factor signaling", discovery and validation pipeline.

- mapping_validation: Validate Tangram spatial mappings using cross-validation, diagnostic plots, and quality metrics. Use when: "validate mapping", "check mapping quality", "is the mapping good", "troubleshoot Tangram", "cross-validate spatial mapping", QC for cell-to-spot mapping.

- multimodal_integration: Integrate multiple modalities - RNA+protein (TotalVI/CITE-seq), RNA+ATAC (MultiVI), or any combination (MOFA). Also handles batch correction with BBKNN. Use when: "integrate CITE-seq", "multiome analysis", "combine RNA and protein", "batch correction", "MOFA integration".

- squidpy_analysis: Squidpy for spatial statistics including neighborhood enrichment, co-occurrence analysis, spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I), Ripley's statistics, and centrality scores. Use when: "are cell types colocalized", "neighborhood enrichment", "spatial patterns", "co-occurrence", "spatially variable genes".

- trajectory_inference: Analyze differentiation trajectories using RNA velocity (scVelo), fate mapping (CellRank), or graph abstraction (PAGA). Use when: "trajectory analysis", "differentiation path", "RNA velocity", "cell fate", "pseudotime", "lineage tracing", developmental dynamics.

**NO_MATCH:** Use for simple queries, general questions, or short commands under 50 characters.
